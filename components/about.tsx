				From fortune 100 companies, startups, and independent clients across the
				country I have been fortunate to work with a diverse range of projects,
				and technologies. My focus has been consistent throught my journey as a
				web developer, to deliver high quality, performance driven and
				accessible web based projects to share with the world. I have a constant
				willingness to learn and collaborate with my peers in order to create
				the best possible product outcomes. I am always looking for new
				opportunities to grow and the next great team to be apart of.
